## Step-by-Step: How This Project Was Built

### 1. Twilio Account & WhatsApp Sandbox Setup
- Created a Twilio account.
- Activated the WhatsApp Sandbox in the Twilio Console.
- Noted the sandbox phone number and unique join code (see above).
- Joined the sandbox by sending the join code from my WhatsApp to the Twilio number.
  
### 2. Together AI for Llama 3 API
- Signed up at Together AI (free tier available).
- Generated an API key for Llama 3 (Meta‚Äôs open-source large language model).
- Chose Together AI because Google Gemini API has regional restrictions and is not always available.
  
### 3. Project Setup
- Initialized a Node.js project and installed dependencies:
- express (web server)
- body-parser (parsing POST requests)
- axios (for API calls)
- twilio (for WhatsApp integration)
- dotenv (for environment variables)
- Wrote the server code to:
- Respond with an INTERNSHIPS LIST on first contact or when prompted.
- Use Together AI‚Äôs Llama 3 to answer user questions.
  
### 4. Environment Variables
- Created a .env file (not committed to GitHub) to securely store the Together AI API key:
```text :   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_ai_api_key_here ```
  
### 5. Local Testing with ngrok
- Ran the server locally with node index.js.
- Used ngrok to expose the local server to the internet:
```text :   ngrok http 3000 ```
- Copied the HTTPS URL from ngrok.

### 6. Connecting Twilio to the Bot
- In the Twilio WhatsApp Sandbox settings, set the ‚ÄúWhen a message comes in‚Äù webhook to:
```text :   https://your-ngrok-or-cloud-url/whatsapp ```
- Clicked Save.

### 7. Public Deployment with Render
- Pushed the project to GitHub (excluding .env and node_modules).
- Created a free web service on Render:
- Connected the GitHub repo.
- Set the root directory to server (if applicable).
- Set the start command to node index.js.
- Added the TOGETHER_API_KEY as an environment variable in Render‚Äôs dashboard.
- Used the Render public URL as the Twilio webhook for 24/7 access.
